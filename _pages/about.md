# About Me

I am a first year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Boston University working with [Dr. Richard West](https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/richwest/index2.html). I am broadly interested in real-time system research. <br/>
<br/>
I received my Master's in Computer Engineering in 2023 from Virginia Tech where I was advised by [Dr. Haibo Zeng](https://www.faculty.ece.vt.edu/zeng/). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at PSG College of Technology, India in 2021.
