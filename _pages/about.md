I am an incoming Ph.D. student to the Department of Computer Science, Boston University. I completed my master's in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech under [Dr. Haibo Zeng](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/zeng.html) in 2023. I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from PSG College of Technology, India in 2021. My research area of interest is computer systems, specifically real-time systems.
