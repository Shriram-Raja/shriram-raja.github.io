I am a first year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Boston University working with [Dr. Richard West](https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/richwest/index2.html). I am broadly interested in real-time system research. <br/>
<br/>
I received my Master's in Computer Engineering in 2023 from Virginia Tech where I was advised by [Dr. Haibo Zeng](https://www.faculty.ece.vt.edu/zeng/). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at PSG College of Technology, India in 2021.

## About My Name
My name is pronounced <embed type="audio/mp3" src="https://hearmyname.bu.edu/Listen/Recording/shriramr.mp3">

<!--[Where](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimbatore) I come from, we follow what is called [patronymic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic#:~:text=In%20Tamil%20Nadu,of%20the%20name.) naming. Following that system, my given name is R. Shriram, where R stands for Raja which is my father's first name. To accomodate with the <given name> <last name> convention that is common in other parts of India and the world I moved the initial to the other side of my first name. So, when I say "Don't call me Raja", I am not asking you to be informal as Raja is <i>literally</i> my father. !-->
